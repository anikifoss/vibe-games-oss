## Rules

- No external assets

## Remixing

Anyone can remix these games and demosâ€”no technical background needed. Follow this simple recipe:

1. Copy the game code into an LLM's input textbox.
   - For best results, enclose the code in a markdown block by adding ``` on new lines before and after the code.
2. Provide a list of changes for the LLM to implement.
   - If you'd rather not apply changes manually, include this line in your prompt: `Produce the complete HTML file with all changes applied.`
3. Copy the LLM's output and save it as a new HTML file (e.g., `game.html`).
4. Open the file in a browser by dragging and dropping it into the window.
   - Bookmark it for quick access.
5. Repeat the process using your modified code as the new starting point.

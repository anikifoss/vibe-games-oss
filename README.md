# vibe-games-oss

A collection of games and demos to showcase the progress of LLM coding capabilities.

Jump to the [website](https://anikifoss.github.io/vibe-games-oss/) to play the games.

## Rules

All the games and demos adhere to the following rules:
- single html page
- JavaScript
- no external dependencies
- no external assets

## Remixing

The idea is that anyone, even without technical background, should be able to remix games and demos following this simple recipe:
- Copy the game code into an LLM input textbox
  - For best results, use the markdown code block by putting ``` on a new line before and after the code
- Provide a list of changes you would like LLM to make
  - If you are not comfortable incorporate changes by hand, then add this line at the end of your prompt: `produce the complete html file with all the changes applied`
- Copy the code produced by LLM and save it into a new html file
  - For example: `game.html`
- Open the saved filed in a browser
  - you can drag and drop the file into the browser window
  - and a bookmark so you can quickly re-load any changes
- Start from the beginning of this recipe, but this time use a copy of your new code!

## Share Your Remixes!
